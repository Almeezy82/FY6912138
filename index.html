This paper will focus on the life of a star from birth to death, starting with the massive cloud of 
gas known as a nebula, succeeding the protostar, a young star. Then going on to look at the different
colours of stars and what causes it, followed by the main sequence, the phase a star spends the most
of its lifetime in. Then they typically turn into a red giant, and later evolving into a number of 
things including a black hole or a supernova.

I Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an MAKE IT LIKE THIS bit LONGER MAYBE .

      <h3>Birth</h3>
        <h4><b>Molecular Clouds</b></h4>
            <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
The birth of Stars begins with the large molecular dust cloud. These are cold, massive clouds of dust and particles that can span up to
hundreds of light years and can range from 1000 to 10 million times the mass (NOT *size*) of the sun (Nasa, 2025). 
            </pre>
            <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Due to the amount of mass they have, the gravitational force of attraction brings the particles closer together making the cloud 
denser. As the particles get closer, they start to collide, and the friction between them causes temperatures to heat up. resulting in 
the development of a protostar. 
            </pre>
     
        <h4><b>Protostar</b></h4>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
A protostar is a hot dense core that consists of a large portion of the dust compressed together so that energy is released as heat and
light. It continues to pull in matter from the rest of the dust cloud around it, causing its size to increase and the temperatures to 
rise (KiwiCo, 2025). 
          </pre>

      <h3><b>Main Sequence</b></h3>
      <pre style="font-family:verdana";>        
The Main Sequence stage is where it spends the majority of its life. It can take 10-100 million years for a protostar to begin the main
sequence depending on the amount of mass collected from the molecular cloud (LCO, 2013). Afterwards, the star can either become a brown
dwarf, a red dwarf, a low-mass star, or a massive star. The mass of a star determines the luminosity (brightness) and its lifespan. 
This is because the more massive a star is, the more energy it must generate to combat the gravitational force. Smaller stars burn 
dimmer but have much longer lifespans, whereas larger stars burn much brighter and have shorter lifespans. This is due to the fact that
the conversion of the star’s mass into energy happens at a much faster rate, resulting in the loss of more energy and therefore a 
shorter lifespan.
      </pre>

      <h4><b>Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</b></h4>
        <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
The HR Diagram is a graph that shows a star’s relation to luminosity based on its temperature (Figure 2). It was found that the cooler 
a star is, the redder it looks, and the hotter it is, the bluer it appears. 
        </pre>
        <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Fun fact: Although Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1911 and Henry Norris Russell in 1913 both carried out the same experiment and obtained the 
same results, they had no knowledge of each other’s work. This level of reproducibility in this experiment provided people with more 
credibility in the relationship between temperature and luminosity.

      <h3><u>Types of Stars</u></h3>     
        <h4><b>Brown Dwarf</b></h4>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Brown dwarfs aren’t technically seen as stars. They lack the mass required to undergo nuclear fusion and therefore emit mostly infrared
light with a small amount of visible light (Nasa, 2024). Over billions of years, the energy is emitted, and the star will shine dimmer 
until it eventually becomes a black dwarf.
          </pre>
        <h4><b>Red Dwarf</b></h4>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Red dwarfs are the smallest main sequence stars. They have a fraction of the Sun’s mass, with the biggest ones being 0.6 solar masses. 
These do undergo fusion and will last for trillions of years. Due to convection, which is where heat is transferred by movement of a 
fluid, red dwarfs will burn out their entire supply of hydrogen. Afterwards, although not yet observed, scientists believe the will 
evolve into a blue dwarf, then white dwarf and finally a black dwarf.
          </pre>
        <h4><b>Low-Mass Stars</b></h4>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Low mass stars consist of stars that have a mass of less than 8 solar masses. They undergo the fusion of hydrogen isotopes into helium, 
but at a much faster rate than red dwarfs, and their lifespans can range from millions to billions of years depending on its mass. When 
the star fuses all the hydrogen in its core into helium, there would be a pressure pushing outwards against the gravitational force 
that makes the star keep its shape instead of collapsing in on itself. Hydrogen fusion begins moving into the star’s outer layers and 
the pressure forces exceed the gravitational force keeping the star small, causing it to expand. This is when it evolves into a red 
giant (Nasa, 2024).
          </pre>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;"->
As a red giant, the star’s core would undergo the fusion of helium into carbon, which also releases energy, and after about 1 billion 
years, the giant begins to pulsate and periodically eject out some of its atmosphere. All the dust removed is called planetary nebula, 
which is dispersed into space and parts can go off to form new stars or planets, and its remaining core would become a white dwarf.
          </pre>

          <figure style="text-align: center;">

            <figcaption style="font-size: 10px;"><i>Figure 3: Image of a supernova taken by the JWST, Scientific American, (2025).</i></figcaption>
          </figure>
      
        <h4><b>Supermassive Stars</b></h4>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Supermassive stars have a mass greater than 8 solar masses. Stars with these conditions radiate more energy than low-mass stars, and 
that energy is further in the blue light range of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is why hotter stars appear bluer. After its main 
sequence is complete, the fusion of hydrogen is then carried out in the star’s outer layers, causing it to expand and evolve into a red 
supergiant. 
          </pre>
          <pre style="font-family:verdana;">
Red supergiants have enough mass to undergo fusion with elements that are heavier than helium. They can fuse elements like carbon, 
oxygen, magnesium, etc. with the heaviest being iron because the fusion of elements any heavier requires energy to be absorbed rather 
than released. This results in the core getting heavier, and once the core’s mass reaches a certain threshold, it collapses in on 
itself due to its own gravity, causing the outer layers to explode out into the universe. This explosion is known as a supernova which 
is essentially a much more extreme outcome as opposed to a planetary nebula (ESA Hubble, 2021).
